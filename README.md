This project is a plugin and an executable GUI for SOFA based on the QtQuick library. This work is based on an initial project from [Anatoscope](www.anatoscope.com). For your information, the roadmap of the project is available on a dedicated [issue](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaQtQuick/issues/1).
